# Game
## High Concept
A two player tower defence!
## Genre
Defence, Strategy/ Real Time Strategy, multiplayer
## Platform
Universal
## Story
The King must defend the outer lands as his enemies from the neighboring kingdom make their way to his castle.
## Esthetics
Esthetics would be realistic but still slightly disproportionate in some ways. All units and towers are viewed from top down. Sound will be 8-bit at best.
## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The person playing defence has the choice of what towers they can put down, where they want to put the them, and what sort of upgrades they want to apply to the them. Their goal is to counter the enemy forces. They receive money for killing enemy units.
The person attacking is given a set amount of money each turn that stacks if not used. They have many different units they can unlock to attack with. This player receives special bonuses when units reach the castle.
### Controls
Mouse:
- Left mouse used to select items
- Right mouse used for information and stats
### Teaching the Game
The concept of the game is already relatively simple, but the users will be given brief promts that direct the user in the right direction.
### Player Learning
 - For the player on defence, they need to learn the weakness of different units and what towers work better at which units, the player also needs to learn where is best to place towers. 
 - The attacking player similarly learns the weaknesses in the defending players defences. And chooses which units to use based on how the previous wave went.
